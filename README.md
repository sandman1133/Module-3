# PyBank

Created a Python script to analyze the financial dataset called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv), which is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 

Each of the following were calculated: 

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My analysis:
